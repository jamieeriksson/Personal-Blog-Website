            I grew up in Dallas, TX where I also attended the University of
            Texas at Dallas to pursue a BS in Mechanical Engineering. It was
            there at UT-Dallas that I was introduced to competitive ultimate
            frisbee in the fall of 2015. Since then I have played 5 years of
            college ultimate, and 4 years of club ultimate where I have attended
            club Nationals twice.

            Been dealing with a little bit of burnout but have been doing my
            best to take care of myself so that I can get back into things
            strongly again. I’ve been working on some throwing form adjustments.
            I tweaked my forehand grip and have been working on my arm mechanics
            to be able to start throwing with my elbow away from my body/hips.
            The motions are starting to feel more comfortable so I’m excited to
            see how it progresses. I was also working on backhand throws this
            evening with a focus on the wind-up and pull through and pulling
            along a straight line. My backhands felt really strong, so that’s a
            win.<br />•<br />I was a little sick on my last A-day with back
            squats and hip thrusters, it was nice to get back to 145lbs on the
            squat and 135lbs for the hip thrusters.<br />•<br />I kind of
            touched on this in a story from this past weekend, but I’ve started
            doing front squats for the first time. The first photo of them was
            really my first time doing them, and I let my ego push the weight at
            105lbs which resulted in unideal form. The second photo was my “fix”
            by going back down to 85lbs so that I could really focus on the
            quality of the movement and implement some tips Mike gave me
            @haddocksportperformance. It’s hard swallowing my pride sometimes.
            It’s easy for me to get caught on this identity of feeling like I
            need to “be strong” and show/exemplify that through heavier weights.
            I had to take a moment and remind myself that it’s okay to be okay
            with starting somewhere that I maybe wish I didn’t have to start.
            But even more so, I realized that getting to start here is exciting,
            it’s amazing. It means that my ceiling is still above me and that I
            have the opportunity to improve, to get better, and to push myself.
            It means that there is still some untapped potential that I get to
            build in myself. I am still able to be better. And that makes me
            feel pretty darned lucky. #HSPathlete
